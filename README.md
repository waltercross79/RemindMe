# RemindMe!
A simple project that will make it easy for me to remember things.

When all the work is completed, I want to use my cell phone and say: "Remind me to change oil in the car in 3 months". 3 months later I will receive a reminder to change oil in my car. 
I want to be able to say: "Remind me to change oil in the car every three months." From that day on, every three months, I will be notified to change the oil. 
I want to be able to say: "Remind me every Tuesday at 6pm to go to the poker tournament". And I will get a reminder every Tuesday at 6pm.
I want to be able to say: "Remind me to give my dog her meds every 30 days."
